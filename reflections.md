> Play with the first 4 prototype knobs to vary timbres produced - some have directly gitchy effects while moved.

> The top highlighted vcf acts as a filter for various frequency components of the generated audio - sweep in.

> The bottom highlighted lfo-1 controls the triggering of granulator freezes and texture cv.

> Play with the blend knob on texture synth to define how clean the signal out is.

> low, sustained tone at medium intensity, gradually fades over ~45 seconds
