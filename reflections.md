> ###### Initially, the working goal I set for myself this week was to remove as many dependencies as possible from this patch. While not wholly successful, since many integral modules such as the turing machine were plugins, I greatly reduced the number of plugins required for the project to run. This was mostly accomplished through the replacement of whatever parts I could with VCV core modules, such as the use of the default VCV sequencer in place of its ordinal clock. Hopefully this makes this branch more usable going forward, for whoever has it next week.

> Once this task was completed, the goal then became to make the synthesizer easier to control. After some experimentation, most control was passed on to two modules, a Befaco Rampage and a Befaco Spring Reverb. The synthesizer is controlled through the four sliders on these two modules.
