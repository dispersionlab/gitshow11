Keeping the original part from file, make rhythm, sound and other adjustments.
Added two new rhythm and sound mixes, create new rhythms and control rhythms through modules such as SEQ, ADSR.
At the beginning I used the modal synthesizer and responder that I used last week, but these two modules are not very operable, so I replaced them with VCO direct output.

>>The six controllers at the top are the main controllers of this instrument. The three on the left control the tones and the three on the right control the volume.

>>At the beginning, the three VCOs on the top left were adjusted to one third,

>>The first column of the two spring reverbs on the right is adjusted to the highest and the other three columns remain unchanged.

>>Maximize the three VCF modulations in the first row,

>>Turn the clock of the leftmost SEQ to half,

>>Adjust the remaining columns of the right spring reverb to the maximum,
Adjust the top three VCOs to two thirds,

>>(Free to play here)

>>At the end, turn the spring reverb from right to left to the lowest order.

It started with a continuous percussion, which quickly turned into something like an orchestral sound with tonality and rhythm.

The tempo gradually accelerated and the tune became cheerful.
Gradually added a percussion sound that echoes the main rhythm, and another mixed sound that is a bit like an echo.

The tones of several voices gradually increased and became crisp.
Slowly to the end, first the mix in the background disappears, then the percussion slowly disappears, but the pitch of the main rhythmic sound rises again. Finally the sound slowly faded to the end.
