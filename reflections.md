> ###### Initially, the working goal I set for myself this week was to remove as many dependencies as possible from this patch. While not wholly successful, since many integral modules such as the turing machine were plugins, I greatly reduced the number of plugins required for the project to run. This was mostly accomplished through the replacement of whatever parts I could with VCV core modules, such as the use of the default VCV sequencer in place of its ordinal clock. Hopefully this makes this branch more usable going forward, for whoever has it next week.

> Once this task was completed, the goal then became to make the synthesizer easier to control. After some experimentation, most control was passed on to two modules, a Befaco Rampage and a Befaco Spring Reverb. The synthesizer is controlled through the four sliders on these two modules.

Similar to the last repo that I had to work on, this score doesn't focus on the piece with timing for when each part should be played, instead putting a focus on the actual instrument, and being able to play it. This is interesting to see, as this is the first I've seen where the instrument is fully explained, with how to control it, and why it was created to be this way.

The recording itself stays much the same throughout, feeling very sparse, with each step in what is felt to be the sequence lasting a couple of beats. A third of the way through a kind of drone note comes in, giving more depth to the piece. There is a considerable amount of echo, and reverb applied, likely due to the spring reverb that is core to the instrument.

I feel that a greater knowledge of what I'm dealing with will be gained by looking at the instrument. While I want to stay with the theme of keeping it all in VCV default modules, I don't know if I will be able to resist putting some more advanced distortion, or modulation modules in the patch.
