###Theme: "Sound of Air_MirrorGarden" the extender of my previous sound work
#####Description:
#######The tunes of the chorus in the soundtrack of Mirror Garden represent three emotional levels of meaning of concordance, compassion, and sadness toward the project. Through the varieties of the musical materials, such as rhythm, harmony, melody, and timbre, to describe a pair of mutually parallel worlds with opposite characteristics. However, as the fundamental features of a mirror mentioned, there must have meta-objects to be mirrored on the other world. Which one is the entity and which one is virtual? The musical material here blurs the identified boundary with a delicate arrangement of various intensities.

This piece has many eitherial qualities, most noticeable  of which is the faint ringing noises that act as its melody. These sounds usually consist of consistent tones that rise and fall in pitch throughout the piece. Around the one minute mark, they begin to rise and fall in tone in a sustained manner before before returning to thier original structure of the rest of the piece. 

The percussion  featured in the piece remains constant, however the structure of the noise changes over time, starting off as a clicking sound at the beginning of the piece, becoming a distorted thumping sound at the 30 second mark. It fades away for a moment before returning ot its original volume, and fluctuates in volume for the rest of the piece. 

In order to improve the initial experience of the next person to experiment with this piece, and attempt to reverse engineer the synthesizer to remove its non-vcv components has been started. While this may effect the final sound of the piece, I believe it will not only allow for a more thorough understanding of the software, but also make the synthesizer more approachable for the next user.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Modifications to this iteration centred around the inclusion of a Rampage module to augment the melodic sounds generated by the rest of the synthesizer. This recording was preformed exclusively by adjusting the values of the sliders on the two Befaco modules. These have been moved to the top of the rack to highlight their importance.

The final version of the recording was preformed in a similar manner.
=======
This iteration of the piece was preformed by slowly increasing the values of the slider on the spring reverb module , then by slowly decreasing the clock speed of the timing module. The ethereal, otherworldly feeling of the original piece  is still present, even though the soundscape has changed to become more artificial.
