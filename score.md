## Components

### Melody

The melody of the instrument is controlled by the turing machine, sending out pulses which are fed through a delay and a reverb, you can change either to alter the sound coming out of them. This part takes up the first two slots of the mixer, being the left and right channels respectively.

### Drones

There are two drones in the piece, one being a more gritty, low frequency made up of 8 VCOs, and the other being a more melodic tone made up of 4 Plaits modules. It is not recommended to change the frequency dials on any of these modules, and the other dials on the Plaits module should be all changed to the same value to keep the tone consistent in the drones.

The drones change their pitch at a rate controlled by an LFO, and the larger drone set also has a filter applied to it with some resonance. Any of these can be changed to fit what your mood is.

Note that after a certain amount of time you may not notice the sound of the drones anymore, and their effects will not be as apparent. If this happens simply mute the drones in the mixer, and unmute them to hear what it is like without them.

### Composition

Start with just the melody section active, fade in the master volume. When ready, fade in the bass drone, then fade in the Plaits drone. When you reach the end of your session, fade the sections out in the same order you faded in, starting with the melody, then the bass drone, then the Plaits drone.

### Performance Issues

It is expected that this patch will cause performance issues. If this happens, remove VCOs from the drones until there are no longer performance issues. This will produce a different sounding final recording, however it is more important to hear what you are playing properly.
