#####Description:
#######The tunes of the chorus in the soundtrack of Mirror Garden represent three emotional levels of meaning of concordance, compassion, and sadness toward the project. Through the varieties of the musical materials, such as rhythm, harmony, melody, and timbre, to describe a pair of mutually parallel worlds with opposite characteristics. However, as the fundamental features of a mirror mentioned, there must have meta-objects to be mirrored on the other world. Which one is the entity and which one is virtual? The musical material here blurs the identified boundary with a delicate arrangement of various intensities.
